> _A CLI program to display the version of the programming languages on your system_


## In short
langfetch is a command-line tool that displays the version of programming languages on your system directly in the terminal. By default, the output comes with an ASCII art representing a logo of a programming language on your system.

langfetch is highly customizable and supports over 40 different languages. You can customize langfetch using flags as well as a configuration file ~/.config/langfetch/config.json (More on customization).
