# Customization

To customize the default behaviour of langfetch, you have to create a file named `~/.config/langfetch/config.json`

Here are the key that you can add:
- **lang**: The lang in ASCII art to display
- **langs**: The langs that should be displayed
- **align**: The vertical-align ("top", "center", "bottom")
- **aligned**: Should it be horizontally aligned (true/false)
- **colors**: The colors that should be used for the logo.
- **color**: The color that should be used for the name of the language
- **sort**: Should it be sorted (true/false)
